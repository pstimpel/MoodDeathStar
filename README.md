## 3D Print the stuff
Using my Prusa I3Mk3 I printed the 2 shells in 0.15mm. The inlays were printed in 0.25mm. I was using filament from https://DasFilament.de. I used silver for the shells, and anthracite for the inlays. The housing for the electronics was printed in "nature", and once I ran out of this filament I was using some silver as well.
